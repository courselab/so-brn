EVALUATION
==============

I could not understand which changes were made to the startup code.

I tried to build test.img using dd plus tyfsedit, but there was not practical
way to write the kernel into the disk.

Booting from disk.img did work but command l='list' does not work properly.
Also, exec seems to invoke print_k, rather than loading and executing the
user program.

It's hard to make an assessment under those circumstances.
